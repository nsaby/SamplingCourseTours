# Specifying an R environment with a runtime.txt file


RStudio: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](http://mybinder.org/v2/gh/nsaby/SamplingCourseTours/master?urlpath=rstudio)


Binder supports using R and RStudio, with libraries pinned to a specific 
snapshot on [MRAN](https://mran.microsoft.com/documents/rro/reproducibility).

**Note:** We recommend to follow [r-conda](https://github.com/binder-examples/r-conda) instead. Especially if you want to use a specific version of R or need faster build times.

**Note:** Another alternative is to use the [holepunch package for R](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/articles/getting_started.html).
